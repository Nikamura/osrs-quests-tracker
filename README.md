## Collection Log Feature

The collection log comparison table displays all items that players have obtained in their collection logs, similar to the [OSRS Wiki Collection Log Table](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Collection_log/Table). Key features include:

- **Item Icons**: High-quality item icons sourced from the OSRS Wiki
- **Item Information**: Item names with links to their respective wiki pages
- **Player Progress**: Visual indicators showing which players have obtained each item
- **Completion Percentages**: Real-time calculation of what percentage of selected players have each item
- **Responsive Filtering**: Dynamically updates when players are selected/deselected
- **Fallback Icons**: Graceful handling of missing item icons with fallback images

The system fetches item metadata from the OSRSBox database to provide rich item information while using the official OSRS Wiki images for the best visual experience.

## Data Sources

- **Primary API**: [RuneLite Player Data API](https://sync.runescape.wiki/runelite/player/{username}/STANDARD)
- **Secondary API**: [OSRSBox Items Database](https://www.osrsbox.com/osrsbox-db/items-summary.json)
- **Item Icons**: [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/)
